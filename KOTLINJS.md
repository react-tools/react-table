# Using Kotlin/JS with React-Table

Kotlin/JS declarations for React Table are maintained externally by the Kotlin/JS community and are located at https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-react-table.

Because React Table is not written in Kotlin/JS and the declarations are not maintained by the core team, there are no guarantees around the declarations always being up to date or working perfectly. If this is an issue for you, please contribute to the community declarations and discuss solutions there.
